An explanation of the Mozilla Source Code Directory Structure and links to
project pages with documentation can be found at:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_Source_Code_Directory_Structure

For information on how to build Mozilla from the source code, see:

    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Build_Documentation

To have your bug fix / feature added to Mozilla, you should create a patch and
submit it to Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org). Instructions are at:

    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_a_patch
    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Getting_your_patch_in_the_tree

If you have a question about developing Mozilla, and can't find the solution
on http://developer.mozilla.org, you can try asking your question in a
mozilla.* Usenet group, or on IRC at irc.mozilla.org. [The Mozilla news groups
are accessible on Google Groups, or news.mozilla.org with a NNTP reader.]

You can download nightly development builds from the Mozilla FTP server.
Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by Mozilla developers for
testing, may be buggy. Firefox nightlies, for example, can be found at:

    MAKEFILE PROJECT : mozilla Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this mozilla project for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your mozilla project.


mozilla.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

mozilla.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

This project allows you to build/clean/rebuild from within Visual Studio by calling the commands you have input 
in the wizard. The build command can be nmake or any other tool you use.

This project does not contain any files, so there are none displayed in Solution Explorer.
