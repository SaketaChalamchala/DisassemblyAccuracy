CSE 524
Name : Saketa Chandra Chalamchala
Project : Study of disassembly accuracy

##################################################################

disassemble.bat : batch disasssembly of binaries
	Command to run : disassemble.bat <source directory of binaries> <destination directory where assembly code should be placed>

		
Application source code :
	Source code for applications studied is under Applications/<Application_name>

Results of Comparison : 
	Results of comparing assembly code generated during compilation and assembly code generated by IDA Pro are under  results = ComparisonResults/<Application_name>
	Folder Structure :
		$results/obj - .o files used in study
		$results/dlls/original - dll files used in study
		$results/dlls/full - stripped dll files used in study
		$results/asms/original - .asm generated during compilation
		$results/asms/disassembled - .asm files generated by disassembling .o files of alppication
		$results/asms/original_dll - .asm files generated by disassembling .dll files of alppication
		$results/asms/full_dll - .asm files generated by disassembling stripped .dll files of alppication
		$results/formatted/original - formatted $results/asms/original files (generated by python code) used for comparison
		$results/formatted/disassembled - formatted $results/asms/disassembled files (generated by python code) used for comparison
		$results/Diff - results of comparing(we are comparing sequence of operations performed in functions) formatted .asm files (generated by python code).
				Format of file : 
					<function_name>
						original code : operators separated by '|' delimiter in original asms
						disassembled code : operators separated by '|' delimiter in disassembled asm 
					end

Code for Comparison : 
	Python code to compare formatted .asm files is present under Python_Source_for_Comparison/
	Sometimes, 'Beyond Compare' tool was used for comparison
	Files :
	
		Diff.py - compares formatted assembly code and writes the output to a file in $results/Diff location
			Command : Diff.py <directory of formatted original asm files> <directory of formatted disassembled asm files> <Diff directory>
		IDAcmdfile.py - formats .asm files generated using disassemble.bat to be used as input for Diff.py
			Command : IDAcmdfile.py <directory of .asm files> <directory of formatted .asm files>
		OBJfile.py - formats .asm files generated on compiling code using Visual Studio to be used as input for Diff.py
			Command : OBJfile.py <directory of .asm files> <directory of formatted .asm files>
		OBJgccfile.py - formats .asm files generated on compiling code using gcc to be used as input for Diff.py
			Command : OBJgccfile.py <directory of .asm files> <directory of formatted .asm files>
			
		Diff_dll_format.py - formats .asm files generated by IDA Pro to have only a sequence of operands and nothing else
			Command : Diff_dll_format.py <directory of .asm files> <directory of formatted .asm files>
		formate_VS_asm.py - formats .asm files generated during source code compilation to have only a sequence of operands and nothing else
			Command : formate_VS_asm.py <directory of .asm files> <directory of formatted .asm files>
		Comparison of formatted files was done using 'Beyond Compare' tool
